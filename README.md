ConnectX
=====================
**ConnectX** is an interactive cross-platform C++ application based on the classical Connect Four game. 
It offers more variants in terms of the number of pieces to connect and the size of the board.

There is no GUI; this is a text-based application.

Computer strategy uses a version of the Minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

It was a **pet-project** to try a more generic design of the game.
It should be reasonably simple to add another variant with more players or dimensions.

Variants:
---------
- 6-by-7 ConnectFour
- 7-by-10 ConnectFour
- 8-by-8 ConnectFour    
- 3-by-6 Connect Three          
- Five-in-a-Row          

Features and Commands:
----------------------
It is possible to play against the computer or another human player.

- Undo `u`
- Restart program `r`
- Change difficulty level `d`
- Quit game  `q`
